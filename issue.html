  <h3 align="left">Depression</h3>
    <p align="justify">
Depression is a big problem in Mexico City. Many people feel sad, tired, and hopeless for a long time. This can happen
because of stress, work problems, family issues, or bad experiences. The city is very busy and crowded, which can make
depression worse. Some people do not ask for help because they feel ashamed, but there are doctors and therapists who
can help with therapy and medicine.

Stress is common in Mexico City because life is very fast and busy. People work long hours, travel in heavy traffic, and

problems, and body pain. Taking breaks, exercising, and spending time with family can help reduce stress.
