<h2>American psychiatrist reveals the causes why some adults refuse to shower</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      Taking a bath may seem like a normal and everyday action, but there are adults who refuse or feel disgusted by it
      for psychological reasons. This goes beyond just a preference or attitude.
<br><br>
Lindsay Standeven, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, says that refusing to bathe is common in people who have
depression. She explains in an interview with The New York Times that people with depression often have trouble with
personal hygiene. Taking a bath can feel like too much effort because they are very tired. For them, the lack of energy
makes it hard to bathe.

<br>    
<h3>Why might someone not want to bathe? </h3>
<p>Standeven says that not bathing can make people feel ashamed, leading to a cycle of low self-esteem and depression.Also, some people think that bathing is a waste of time. They do not see personal hygiene as important in their daily life.
People who are stressed or exhausted may also see bathing as something extra they don’t need to do. They might delay it until they feel it’s really necessary.
Psychologist Borja Quicios says that some people may refuse to bathe because of a past bad experience, like falling or having a traumatic accident in childhood or adolescence.
<br><br>
Ablutophobia: Fear of bathing Another reason for refusing to bathe is a fear called ablutophobia. 
<br>
This is an intense, irrational fear of bathing or doing things related to hygiene. In children, this fear usually
starts between the ages of 7 and 11 and may look like normal childish rebellion. But in adults, it can cause serious
problems, affecting their health, social life, and work. Ablutophobia can come from bad experiences in the past or
room seeing family members avoid bathing. It is important to get treatment to help people with this fear and reduce
its effects on their daily life.
